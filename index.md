### Hi, This is Shiwen Shan (单诗雯) 👋
I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in <img src="assets/img/OIP.jpg" width="25" height="25"> Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I completed my bachelor's degree at the same institution 😉.

I am supervised by 
<a href="https://yxsu.github.io/" class="highlighted">Prof. Su</a> and <a href="https://www.zibinzheng.com/" class="highlighted">Prof. Zheng</a>.

My research focuses on **improving the reliability and performance of large-scale, complex software systems**. I am particularly interested in exploring innovative approaches to enhance system performance, including improving diagnosability, reducing storage and computational costs, and optimizing system efficiency.
Feel free to <a href="mailto:shanshw@mail2.sysu.edu.cn" class="highlighted">contact me</a> for discussions and collaborations!
